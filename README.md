# Exploratory Data Analysis of Electric Cars in Germany Using SQL

This project focuses on conducting Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using SQL, specifically MySQL, to extract useful insights from a dataset containing information about electric cars currently available for sale in Germany. 

## Dataset

Welcome to the "Electric Vehicle Specifications and Prices" dataset, a comprehensive collection of data meticulously scraped from EV Database, https://ev-database.org/.

This dataset presents a detailed exploration of various electric vehicles, providing valuable insights into their specifications, pricing, and performance metrics.

## SQL Queries and Analysis
This project showcases proficiency in SQL through the following aspects:

- **Data Retrieval**: Complex SQL queries have been employed to retrieve relevant data from the dataset, enabling targeted analysis of electric cars' attributes and properties.
- **Data Transformation**: SQL has been used to transform and manipulate the dataset as needed, facilitating the calculation of derived metrics and the preparation of data for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Through SQL queries, exploratory data analysis has been performed to gain insights into the distribution, trends, and relationships within the dataset. This includes analyzing the distribution of battery capacities, ranges, speeds, accelerations, as well as examining the popularity of different brands and models.
- **Data Aggregation and Summarization**: SQL aggregation functions have been utilized to summarize key metrics and statistics, providing a comprehensive overview of the dataset.
